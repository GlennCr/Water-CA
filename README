Instructions for Downloading and Running the CA Water Simulator

1. Click the .ZIP button at the top of page (or click this link: https://github.com/GlennCr/Water-CA/zipball/master )
2. Save the file to your computer, and extract it to a location on your computer.
3. Open the extracted folder. Inside you will find a folder labeled 'Current Build'.
4. Open the 'Current Build' folder. Inside you should find the executable, 'ca_water_prototype.exe'
5. Double-click the executable 'ca_water_prototype.exe'. A new window should appear.
6. Instructions on how to use the application will be displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
  6a. Use the left mouse button to add 'wall' cells (holding shift will delete cells). 
  6b. Use the right mouse button to add 'water' cells (holding shift will create 'water' cells faster.)

Note on running the current build:
  CA Water uses the XNA framework, part of the Microsoft .NET 4 framework. If you have difficulty running the executable, 
    - Ensure you have an up to date version of Microsoft .NET ( http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718 )
    - Ensure you have an up to date version of the XNA Framework Redistributable (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914)

Features In Development:

# Water Pressure
  - Using a process based upon what is described here: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131954/interview_the_making_of_dwarf_.php?page=9
# Queued Rule Operations 
  - Currently the system is limited to using cells of 4px X 4px or larger in order to maintain a reasonable framerate of 30fps or higher. Implementing a Queue for rule execution will likely allow displaying a screen of 1px X 1px cells in real time   
# Library
  - Porting the code to an extensible library will simplify implementing this code into future applications and open the possibility for developing educational tools.


Special thanks to Professor Gerald Farin for clarifying the properties of compressible and incompressible liquids! With his advice the simulation has greatly improved.
