Second attempt at a working Cellular Automata Water Sim.

This article proved extremely helpful: http://w-shadow.com/blog/2009/09/01/simple-fluid-simulation/

Helped me get my rule updates in order, much better than it was before.

Also implemented water compression based on what was shown in the article. I moved my implementation away from floating point though.


One thing too note, that's odd about adding water compression: In situations where Water Pressure should take effect (i.e. water in a U-Pipe), compression alone does SORT of accomplish the thing. As it it were VERY low pressure...

I'm thinking of implementing water pressure similar to how it was described here: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131954/interview_the_making_of_dwarf_.php?page=10
