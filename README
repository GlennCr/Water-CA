Working on Water Pressure, and tweaking aspects of water flow (I really would like it to even itself out faster you see)

I'm going to try and implement water pressure similar to how it was described here: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131954/interview_the_making_of_dwarf_.php?page=9


Special thanks for Professor Farin for pointing out water does not compress! If anyone does use the w-shadow example as a basis for water CA (linked in first attempt) bear in mind that it won't accurately model water!
