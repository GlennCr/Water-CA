What is Water-CA?

 Water-CA is a proof of concept and prototype fluid simulator, which is currently being reworked into the 'Canals' framework.

 The intention is to use the concepts developed here within a framework to introduce students to programming and computer science at Camp Game this Summer. (Camp Game is an educational program for Middleschool and Highschool students, run by the School of Computing and Informations in the Summer. The program is designed to teach students concepts of programming, computer science and mathematics, and foster interest in computer science and engineering)

 Water-CA will also be used to produce a basic game to demonstrate actual applications of the system later this Spring.

What does CA stand for?

 The CA stands for 'Cellular Automata'. Cellular Automata is a system for simulating the behavior of models with discrete states. The system is based upon the work of Jon von Neuman on self-replicating systems in the 1940s, and was further expanded by the research of Gustav A. Hedlund in the 1960s.

 Cellular Automations consist of a grid,  a set of cells arranged in a regular pattern (typically rows and columns). Cells are abstract entity which exist in one of several possible discrete states. (these states can be determined by the programmer.) A list of rules or functions are then evaluated upon every cell within the grid set, with the output being an altered grid set. The rules evaluated on a particular cell are selected based on the state of adjacent cells; these adjacent cells make up what is called the 'neighbor' set. Each successive grid generated by rule evaluation is refered to as a 'round' or 'generation'.

 One interesting result of Cellular Automata is the tendency to generate very complex systems in appearance, which in reality are produced by a small set of simple rules. (A good example is 'Conway's Game of Life', which produces a wide variety of interesting and intricate animations from 4 simple rules) 

** Why use Cellular Automation to simulate Fluid?

 Cellular Automation has the interesting property of generating what appear to be complex systems, which in reality  are just the results of a simple, low cost calculations. Water-CA runs on three general rules for example, (converted into code of course)

 1. Cells with water can give a portion of that volume to their bottom neighbor if it is not full.
 2. Cells with water can move a portion of that volume into their left or right neighbor if they have less volume.
 3. Cells do not move volume into cells in the Wall State.

 The result is a very quick, cheap algorithm that creates an approximation of the flow of water. While not accurate or complete (without the aid of external operations), it is far less resource intensive than running accurate fluid dynamics simulations. In the context of real time rendering this stands out as a highly valuable trait.



Instructions for Downloading and Running the CA Water Simulator

1. Click the .ZIP button at the top of page (or click this link: https://github.com/GlennCr/Water-CA/zipball/master )
2. Save the file to your computer, and extract it to a location on your computer.
3. Open the extracted folder. Inside you will find a folder labeled 'Current Build'.
4. Open the 'Current Build' folder. Inside you should find the executable, 'ca_water_prototype.exe'
5. Double-click the executable 'ca_water_prototype.exe'. A new window should appear.
6. Instructions on how to use the application will be displayed in the top left corner of the screen.
  6a. Use the left mouse button to add 'wall' cells (holding shift will delete cells). 
  6b. Use the right mouse button to add 'water' cells (holding shift will create 'water' cells faster.)

Note on running the current build:
  CA Water uses the XNA framework, part of the Microsoft .NET 4 framework. If you have difficulty running the executable, 
    - Ensure you have an up to date version of Microsoft .NET ( http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=17718 )
    - Ensure you have an up to date version of the XNA Framework Redistributable (http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=20914)

Features In Development:

# Water Pressure
  - Using a process based upon what is described here: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131954/interview_the_making_of_dwarf_.php?page=9
# Queued Rule Operations 
  - Currently the system is limited to using cells of 4px X 4px or larger in order to maintain a reasonable framerate of 30fps or higher. Implementing a Queue for rule execution will likely allow displaying a screen of 1px X 1px cells in real time   
# Library
  - Porting the code to an extensible library will simplify implementing this code into future applications and open the possibility for developing educational tools.


Special thanks to Professor Gerald Farin for clarifying the properties of compressible and incompressible liquids! With his advice the simulation has greatly improved.

in Section 2.1.

3. Responsibilities
-------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
*                                                                      *

*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *
*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any    *

*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

*                                                                      *

-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
